WP.org Handbook Callout blocks adapted from the WP.org Handbook plugin for use in posts and pages.

## Description

The make.wordpress.org blog has wonderful callout blocks but they seem to be baked in as part of the WP.org [Handbook plugin](https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/browser/sites/trunk/wordpress.org/public_html/wp-content/plugins/handbook).

I was able to strip out the relevant parts of the Handbook plugin retaining only the callout blocks.

## Special Thanks
